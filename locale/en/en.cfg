palette-cleanser-color-scheme=(More profiles coming soon!)  Select from available profiles designed to work around various forms of color vision deficiency.  Or, if you're an advanced user, you can choose Custom, then edit color-schemes.lua in the mod's zip folder to choose your own palette.
palette-cleanser-enable-turret-range=Capsules, grenades, turrets, and artillery ranges all get a boost in visibility, so you'll know what you're shooting at.
palette-cleanser-enable-roboport-area=Roboport logistics and construction service areas are highlighted with alternate hues for easier logistification in the world, and on the map.
palette-cleanser-enable-electric-pole-drill=Electric poles and electric drills benefit from a sharper contrasting service area overlay.
palette-cleanser-enable-resources-terrain=Resource patches are much easier to identify and discriminate when you can actually see them.  Plus in a shocking twist of colorist cruelty, we muted the map colors of those annoying sandy beach tiles so they're harder to see and not as distracting.
palette-cleanser-enable-fluids=It's all about the light oil!  Well, mostly.  Light oil and all its recipes and icons get a total makeover with a fresh new color.  Other fluids also look nicer in pipes and tanks thanks to enhanced contrast.
palette-cleanser-enable-ammo=Cluster grenades get a radical new splash of color, and explosive cannon shells finally get some explosive markings.  Go blow some stuff up!
palette-cleanser-enable-logistics=Filter inserters and active provider chests get color tweaks so they quit clogging up your inventory while you keep accidentally picking up more of them.  Also, requester chests are now bluer than blue so you quit mistaking them for buffer chests.
palette-cleanser-enable-wires=You'll need some thicker wires to carry the power of all those enhancements!  These signal wires and power lines are easier to see because they're hefty.  This option makes wires stand out against the background, and enables the optional blue wire in the next setting.
palette-cleanser-signal-wire-mode=Thicker wires are great (and required for this option) but Blue is even better!  Red and Green are sometimes easy for us to mix up (even with copper sometimes, yikes!), so pick up a fancy new spool of blue wire and start building the Nauvis Network in style.
