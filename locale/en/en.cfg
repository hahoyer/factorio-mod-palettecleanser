palette-cleanser-color-scheme=(More profiles coming soon!)  Select from the available profiles designed to work around various forms of color vision deficiency.  Or, if you're an advanced user, you can choose Custom, then edit color-schemes.lua in the mod's zip folder to choose your own palette.
palette-cleanser-enable-turret-range=Capsules, grenades, turrets, and artillery ranges all get a boost in visibility.
palette-cleanser-enable-roboport-area=Roboport logistics and construction service areas are highlighted with alternate hues both in the world, and on the map.
palette-cleanser-enable-electric-pole-drill=Electric poles and electric drills benefit from a higher-contrast service area overlay.
palette-cleanser-enable-resources-terrain=Resource patches will have much clearer color differences.  Plus, in a shocking twist of colorist cruelty, we mute the map colors of sandy beach tiles so they aren't as distracting.
palette-cleanser-enable-fluids=Light oil and related recipes and icons get a total makeover with a fresh new color.  Other fluids also look nicer, with enhanced contrast in pipes and tanks.
palette-cleanser-enable-ammo=Cluster grenades get a radical new splash of color, and explosive cannon shells get some explosive markings.
palette-cleanser-enable-logistics=Filter inserters and active provider chests are bright pink, and requester chests are true blue.
palette-cleanser-enable-thick-wires=Thicker signal wires and power lines really stand out against the background.
palette-cleanser-signal-wire-mode=Red and Green are not always easy to distinguish, so replace one with a fancy new spool of Blue wire and build the Nauvis Network in style.

palette-cleanser-force-map-rechart=Rechart map with updated colors
